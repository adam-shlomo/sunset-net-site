# Sunset Net

> The AI orchestrator for network engineers.

Sunset Net is a decision-support tool that lets network engineers describe what they want their network to do in plain English. It generates vendor-specific configuration, cross-checks topology for conflicts, and surfaces a diff for human review — before any changes are applied.

## Key Features

- Natural-language to network configuration (Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR, JunOS, Nokia SR-OS)
- Human-in-the-loop approval workflow — no changes without explicit operator consent
- Topology-aware conflict detection
- Rollback snapshots before every change
- Tamper-evident audit log of all approvals
- SafetyGuard system with mandatory safety onboarding

## How It Works

1. Connect to your lab devices via SSH
2. Describe your intent in plain English (e.g., "configure OSPF area 0 on all lab devices")
3. Sunset Net generates vendor-specific configuration using AI (Anthropic Claude)
4. Review the generated config and approve or deny
5. Changes are applied only after explicit human approval
